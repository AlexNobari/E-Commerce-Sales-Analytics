# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Analytics

**Tools Used:** SQL, Tableau, Python (pandas), Power BI  
**Project Duration:** June 2025 – Present

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a full analytics solution for an online retail business, using over 500K+ real-world transactions. The goal was to uncover customer behavior, product performance, and regional sales trends to guide marketing, inventory optimization, and sales strategies.

The dataset was cleaned and analyzed using SQL for data wrangling and transformation, followed by interactive Tableau dashboards that visualize key KPIs, sales patterns, and geographic performance. Python was used to prototype trend analytics, and Power BI was briefly used to replicate key insights for management-facing reports.

## 🔍 Key Features
- SQL for ETL: cleaned & joined large datasets
- Tableau dashboards with dynamic filters and KPIs
- Python (pandas) for trend analysis
- Power BI prototype for management reporting
